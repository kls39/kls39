## Hi there 👋

My name is Kaitlyn, and I am a student at the University of South Carolina Beaufort.

I am currently studying Informational Science and Technology, and concentrated in Cybersecurity.

I am currently learning Java programming in my current class(es) and have taken a class in Python programming in the past. 💬

In my free time I like to play video games online with friends and listen to music while enjoying a peaceful destination in nature. 🎮

I'm always open to suggestions for my career path, and happy to hear about others personal journeys in the world of technology. 👥

My inspiration for my career path choice was inspired by my mother and stepfather, one of which is an architectural engineer, and other is a geographical engineer. 💭

I am born and raised in Bluffton, South Carolina. 🌴
