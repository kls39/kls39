## Hi there 👋

My name is Kaitlyn, and I am a student at the University of South Carolina Beaufort.

I am currently studying Informational Science and Technology, and concentrated in Cybersecurity.
I am currently learning Java programming in my current class(es) and have taken a class in Python programming in the past.
In my free time I like to play video games online with friends and listen to music while enjoying a peaceful destination in nature.
I'm always open to suggestions for my career path, and happy to hear about others personal journeys in the world of technology.
My inspiration for my career path choice was inspired by my mother and stepfather, one of which is an architectural engineer, and other is a geographical engineer.

Random facts about me:
I am a cat person.
I get more accomplished at night.
My favorite color is green.
I am born and raised in Bluffton, South Carolina.
